Meanwhile, as touring came to a complete standstill, global music revenue declined by 25 percent as a whole,<sup>1</sup> and musicians lost two-thirds of their income.<sup>2</sup> As a result, music artists continue to pursue alternative sources of revenue, including through catalogue sales.<sup>3</sup> These factors, among others, may partially contribute to the increase in catalog sales at historically high prices.<sup>4</sup> Under these circumstances, some musicians may seek to exercise their statutory right to reacquire previously transferred copyrights (referred to in practice as the \u201ccopyright termination right\u201d or the \u201ctermination right\u201d) in order to renegotiate their original deals under current favorable market conditions.</p> <p>In trying to reclaim a copyright, a critical question is whether the copyright assignment was treated as a \u201csale\u201d or \u201clicense\u201d for income tax purposes.</p> <p>In general, an author\u2014including a musician\u2014can reacquire profitable copyrights if the author is able to terminate the grant that transferred the copyright interest. Recognizing that many authors historically had transferred their copyrights from a position of unequal bargaining power, Congress enacted Section 203 of the Copyright Act when it last overhauled the copyright regime in 1976. This statute allows certain individual authors to terminate transfers of their copyrighted works that were transferred on or after January 1, 1978, between 35 and 40 years after the initial grant by license or sale, subject to certain statutory requirements.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>In this context, a \u201cgrant\u201d includes any sale of a copyright or any license of a copyright (exclusive or nonexclusive), lasting for a period longer than 35 years.<sup>6</sup> Notably, the author may reclaim the transferred copyright(s) from the grantee (or their successor in interest) without paying consideration; the author simply needs to send a notice of termination to the grantee (or their successor in interest).<sup>7</sup> Moreover, the copyright termination right is completely inalienable and cannot be transferred or waived by contract.<sup>8</sup> While powerful, the termination right has limitations. Significantly, it does not apply to works made for hire, which includes works created by employees or works created by independent contractors specially commissioned as part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>To date, the copyright termination right has become an important issue in the music business, as high-profile artists such as Prince (prior to his passing) have sent termination notices to major record labels.<sup>10</sup> Many lesser known artists have followed suit.<sup>11</sup> Motion picture studios have also started to receive termination notices with respect to many scripts, including\u2014ironically\u2014The Terminator.<sup>12</sup> While delivery of termination notices has increasingly become more common, there is no specific guidance on how the exercise of the right is taxed, which is a critical consideration of which all authors should be informed.</p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Copyright%20Termination%20Rights/#origins","title":"Origins","text":""},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Copyright%20Termination%20Rights/#farts","title":"farts","text":"<p>The appropriate tax treatment of the copyright termination right necessarily reflects its statutory origins. Congress created this unique right to \u201csafeguard\u201d authors in case they entered into a deal before their work could truly be valued and, therefore, effectively allows them to reevaluate their work\u2019s true value once enough data is available.<sup>13</sup> The question arises, however, whether Congress may have created income tax risks for the same individual authors it aimed to protect, given that taxpayers are required to recognize income from any source derived.<sup>14</sup> In other words, when a taxpayer disposes of a property interest and later is granted a new ownership interest in that same property when the value is substantially higher, the taxpayer generally recognizes income equal to the property\u2019s value at the time of reacquisition. Accordingly, whether the exercise of the reversion of the previously transferred interest results in a taxable event is a critical consideration for authors when they are determining whether to exercise their termination right (in addition to legal costs). Terminations effected for copyright transfers after January 1, 1978, began in 2013 and have been rising in number ever since, yet neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any court decision has provided direct guidance on taxation of exercising the termination right.</p> <p>Due to the lack of guidance, a worst-case scenario would be that the IRS or state taxing authority might take a position that the reversion is fully taxable, which would hurt the same individual authors Congress aimed to protect. To counter this position, it is necessary to distill this extremely negative result and offer a more complete analysis as to why the reversion should not be taxable and, for those authors to whom it is relevant, the holding period of the copyright should date back to the original ownership. Accordingly, individuals who create copyrightable works that are not works made for hire, such as musicians, screenwriters, comic book writers, novelists, and others, should be aware of the income tax risks, and any tax planning opportunities, associated with their termination right.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>Thus, a deeper understanding of the copyright termination right will aid in mapping out the appropriate income tax consequences. As noted, termination rights under Section 203 of the Copyright Act can take effect between 35 years and 40 years after the initial grant of the copyright by the author to a third party. The author must send the termination notice between 2 and 10 years prior to the effective date of the termination, which means notice must be served between 25 and 38 years after the transfer.<sup>16</sup> During the period between service of the termination notice and the effective date of the termination, the author cannot enter into a new deal with a third party, but may enter into a new deal (i.e., renegotiate) with the original grantee or its successor in interest.<sup>17</sup></p> <p>In addition to not applying to works made for hire, the copyright termination right has other notable limitations. First, when joint authors enter into an agreement, a majority of the joint authors must exercise the right in order to terminate the grant.<sup>18</sup> Second, the termination right only causes U.S. copyright interests to revert to the author.<sup>19</sup> Accordingly, the exercise of the termination right does not affect foreign copyright rights or other intellectual property rights, such as rights to name and likeness or trademarks, transferred as part of the agreement. Last, termination does not affect ownership of derivative works created under authority of the original grant.<sup>20</sup></p> <p>Given the complexity created by these limitations, many authors choose not to exercise their copyright termination rights. Instead, renegotiating with the original grantee may prove the better option because the author likely will still have some relationship with the grantee going forward, even after a termination, due to foreign rights or other intellectual property rights that the original grantee continues to retain.<sup>21</sup> In fact, renegotiation may have been the implied congressional intent, given the exclusive negotiation period for the author and original grantee between service of the notice and the effective termination date. Moreover, in many cases, it is unlikely that a copyright retains value 35 to 40 years after original publication such that an author will incur the effort, and costs, of termination.</p> <p>Accordingly, a copyright creator has three options when serving a termination notice: 1) reclaim the copyright on the termination\u2019s effective date, retain his or her ownership, and enter into new license agreement(s) to monetize the asset going forward; 2) wait for the copyright to revert and sell it to any third party; or 3) renegotiate with the original transferee for additional proceeds during the aforementioned 2 to 10 year exclusive negotiation period commencing on the date the termination notice is served and ending on the termination effective date. The income tax consequences of these options should first be considered in light of the general tax principles that apply to copyrights.</p> <p>A copyright created by an individual creator through his or her personal efforts is an ordinary asset for federal income tax purposes, the gain from the sale of which results in ordinary income, which, under current law, is subject to 17 percent more income tax than if the asset were a capital asset held by the taxpayer for more than one year.<sup>22</sup> Although musicians create music assets that otherwise fall within that construct, the tax law provides taxpayers the ability to elect capital gain treatment if the gain arises in connection with the sale of musical compositions or copyrights in musical works.<sup>23</sup> The terms \u201cmusical compositions\u201d and \u201ccopyrights in musical works,\u201d however, are not defined under the tax law, and, accordingly, it is appropriate to look to copyright law to define the scope of these terms for income tax purposes.</p> <p>Under the Copyright Act, \u201cmusical composition\u201d means music (melody, rhythm, and/or harmony expressed in a system of musical notation) and accompanying words (lyrics), if any.<sup>24</sup> \u201cCopyrights in musical works\u201d is a broader copyright term that includes original compositions and original arrangements or other new versions of earlier compositions to which new copyrightable authorship has been added.<sup>25</sup> Accordingly, if a musician is the owner of, and sells, a musical composition or copyright in a musical work, the musician may elect to treat the asset as the sale of a capital asset eligible for capital gain treatment.<sup>26</sup> Therefore, if the musician has a long-term holding period in the copyright (i.e., has held it for more than one year), the gain recognized on the sale may be taxed at preferential long-term capital gain rates (currently, 20 percent), rather than higher ordinary income tax rates (currently, a maximum of 37 percent).</p> <p>Non-musicians, however, are not as fortunate. For example, book authors, comic artists, screenwriters, and the like who sell a self-created copyright will be subject to ordinary income tax rates, and, accordingly, their holding period with respect to the copyright is not relevant for purposes of character of the gain, because gain from the sale of their copyright is not eligible for capital gain.</p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Copyright%20Termination%20Rights/#sale-or-license","title":"Sale or License","text":"<p>Since the copyright termination right may permit the copyright creator the ability to terminate a license or sale agreement and reclaim the copyright, a critical question is whether the copyright assignment was treated as a \u201csale\u201d or \u201clicense\u201d for income tax purposes. Generally, the owner of a copyright for income tax purposes is the person who, based on all of the facts and circumstances, has the \u201cbenefits and burdens\u201d of ownership.<sup>27</sup> The benefits of ownership, for example, are the rights that a copyright owner has under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, such as the right to exploit and reproduce the copyrighted work.<sup>28</sup> Burdens of ownership may include a third party bringing an action for copyright infringement against the copyright holder.</p> <p>For income tax purposes, a transfer of the copyright, whether by assignment or exclusive license, to a third party in exchange for consideration for the life of the copyright is treated as a \u201csale,\u201d whereas any transfer of the copyright for less than the life of the copyright or nonexclusive license is treated as a \u201clicense.\u201d<sup>29</sup> The distinction is important because if a transfer agreement is treated as a license for income tax purposes, the tax analysis with respect to the exercise of the copyright termination right is fairly straightforward. Under a license arrangement, the copyright holder never relinquishes ownership of the copyright but, rather, permits the licensee to use the copyright for a specified period of time or for a specified purpose. When the license is terminated, the right to use the copyright correspondingly terminates, but ownership of the copyright is always maintained by the licensor for income tax purposes. A termination of a license arrangement generally should not result in a tax liability to the licensor.<sup>30</sup> Furthermore, a renegotiation of the license with the original licensee should be treated similarly with respect to the termination of the original deal.</p> <p>If, however, a transfer agreement was treated as a sale for income tax purposes (whether by actual sale or perpetual exclusive license), the taxation of a reversion of the copyright to the creator pursuant to a copyright termination right exercise is unclear, as there are no tax authorities addressing the tax consequences. The three primary issues are 1) whether there is a taxable event upon the previously sold copyrights reverting to the seller as a result of exercising the termination right, 2) whether the seller may recognize long-term capital gain if the seller reclaims the copyright and subsequently sells the copyright, and 3) how a renegotiation with the original grantee should be viewed from an income tax perspective.</p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Copyright%20Termination%20Rights/#option-or-reversionary-interest","title":"Option or Reversionary Interest","text":"<p>The income tax consequence of exercising a copyright termination right is a critical determining factor as to whether to exercise the right and/or how to structure any termination of the transfer. The author may choose not to exercise the termination right if terminating the transfer of the copyright would result in a substantial tax liability without the receipt of cash to cover the tax. Accordingly, it is important to understand whether an author who sold his or her copyright recognizes taxable income upon reversion of the copyright interest pursuant to the termination right. The crux of the analysis is determining the character of the termination right based on general income tax principles. Possible income tax characterizations may be that the termination right is a compensatory option, a non-compensatory option, or a reversionary property interest.<sup>31</sup></p> <p>The IRS theoretically could assert that the copyright termination right is a compensatory option on the theory that the author\u2019s personal efforts created the asset and the termination right materializes by statute upon the creation of the asset.<sup>32</sup> Under this construct, the termination right could be viewed as an option to reacquire the copyright in 35-40 years after transfer at an exercise price of zero. Upon exercise of a compensatory option, an option holder generally must include in income the difference between the fair market value of the property acquired and the exercise price, which would result in the author\u2019s recognizing ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the copyright at the time the copyright reverts to the author.<sup>33</sup></p> <p>Not only is this result inconsistent with the general policy of the copyright termination right safeguarding the author, under applicable law, compensatory options generally are options granted by a service recipient to \u201cemployees or independent contractors\u201d in connection with the performance of services.<sup>34</sup> In the context of an individual author, no employee or independent contractor relationship exists at the time of creation or at the time of a sale and, thus, treatment of the termination right as a compensatory option is not appropriate.<sup>35</sup></p> <p>In accordance with the underlying policy of safeguarding the author, a reversion that does not result in a tax liability would be the more equitable and likely outcome. For example, another possibility for income tax purposes is that the copyright termination right may be treated as a non-compensatory option in the hands of the creator on the basis that the option springs into existence in connection with, and upon the sale of, the copyright to the initial grantee. Under general tax principles, the exercise of a non-compensatory call option generally does not create taxable income upon the purchase of the underlying property to which the option relates.<sup>36</sup> If this were the case, however, the holding period of the copyright would start on the date that the copyright reverts to the author.<sup>37</sup> Holding periods, however, are irrelevant to non-musicians given that, upon a sale, their self-created copyrights are ordinary assets, subject to ordinary income tax rates, and not eligible to be treated as capital assets for which holding periods are meaningful. Musicians, however, may elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets. But should the musician immediately resell the reclaimed copyright, the sale would be subject to ordinary income tax rates because capital gain on an asset held for one year or less is short-term capital gain subject to ordinary income tax rates.<sup>38</sup></p> <p>Fortunately for musicians, however, an alternative avenue exists. The copyright termination right more likely should be treated as a future reversionary interest that vests upon service of the termination notice. Under The Third Restatement of Property Law, a \u201cfuture interest\u201d is an \u201cownership interest in property that does not currently entitle the owner to possession or enjoyment of the property.\u201d<sup>39</sup> The Restatement further describes any future interest held by a transferor of property as a \u201creversion.\u201d<sup>40</sup> The terminations right appears to fit this description.</p> <p>With respect to reversions, the Tax Court has held that a lessor\u2019s reversionary interest in a 99-year ground lease does not get taxed until the future interest is sold or redeemed, implying that the vesting of the future interest after 99 years does not result in taxable income.<sup>41</sup> The copyright termination right may be treated similarly for income tax purposes. Accordingly, characterizing the termination right as a reversionary property interest generally should not result in taxable income upon the termination\u2019s taking effect, which aligns with congressional intent to safeguard authors.</p> <p>Notably, taxpayers who hold a future interest generally start their holding period upon acquisition of the future interest (i.e., upon the author\u2019s creation of the copyright), not upon the reversion, regardless of whether the future interest is vested or contingent.<sup>42</sup> Thus, the musician should still be eligible for long-term capital gain even if the musician sells the musical composition or copyright in the musical work immediately after the copyright termination right reversion. Accordingly, under this reversionary interest construct, the author may reclaim the copyright without recognizing tax upon exercise of the termination right and retain his or her original holding period such that, in the case of a musician, long-term capital gain treatment on a subsequent, immediate sale is possible.</p> <p>Under this reversionary interest construct, the income tax consequences of a renegotiation with the original grantee appear to be in line with congressional intent to provide musicians with the ability to elect capital gain treatment. If viewed as a future interest, then a renegotiation likely should constitute a sale of a future interest in the musical copyright to the original grantee and should fall squarely within the purview of the Internal Revenue Code Section 1221(b)(3) election to treat sales or exchanges of musical compositions or copyrights in musical works as capital assets. In contrast, if viewed as an option, the closing of the renegotiation may be treated as the cancellation of the option, given that the effect is that the taxpayer will not reclaim the musical composition or copyright in a musical work to either retain ownership or sell it to a third party. Gain recognized from termination of a right (such as an option) with respect to property that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer is treated as gain from the sale of a capital asset.<sup>43</sup> In the case of a musical composition or copyright in musical work, however, the asset in the hands of the taxpayer is an ordinary asset that requires the taxpayer to make an affirmative election to treat the underlying asset as a capital asset upon a sale or exchange. Accordingly, there is risk that the IRS may treat the gain from the deemed termination of the option as ordinary income if the ability to elect otherwise is not taken into account.<sup>44</sup></p> <p>While it is unclear how a taxing authority or a court would rule on the characterization issue from a tax perspective, the statutory language and federal case law suggest that the copyright termination right resembles a reversionary interest more than it does an option from a non-tax perspective. In fact, the termination right statute itself provides that the copyright rights in a terminated grant \u201crevert\u201d to the author once the termination takes effect and that the \u201cfuture rights\u201d become \u201cvested\u201d once the author serves the termination notice.<sup>45</sup> Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court described the post-termination interest as a \u201creversion,\u201d<sup>46</sup> and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals referred to the termination right as a \u201cfuture interest.\u201d<sup>47</sup></p> <p>On the other hand, the fact that the author may exercise the right at-will seems more like an option. As noted above, however, gain recognized in connection with exercising a non-compensatory option followed by an immediate sale of the copyright to a third party or exercising the copyright termination right to renegotiate with the original transferee may result in ordinary income, which does not synchronize with congressional intent to provide capital gain treatment to musicians and safeguard authors with a termination right. In addition, options generally have strike prices in excess of zero, and option holders usually pay premiums in exchange for their options. Treating the termination right as an option would require concluding that it represents an option with a zero strike price for which the author paid no premium. Furthermore, treating the termination right as a non-compensatory option seems like an odd result because the non-compensatory option may be ignored for income tax purposes, given that an option with an exercise price of zero may be sufficiently certain to be exercised during the exercise period since the option likely will be \u201cin the money.\u201d<sup>48</sup></p> <p>The unique nature of the copyright termination right presents a gray area in terms of characterization for income tax purposes. On balance, however, treatment as a reversionary property interest appears more accurate from a non-tax perspective and would harmonize Congress\u2019s intent underlying the termination right to safeguard authors with more recent congressional intent to provide capital gains eligibility to musicians.</p> <p>A judge presiding over one of the many litigations regarding the rights to Superman once said that \u201c[the] intricate [termination] provisions oftentimes create unexpected pitfalls that thwart or blunt the effort of the terminating party to reclaim the full measure of the copyright in a work of authorship.\u201d<sup>49</sup> Tax considerations further complicate this already complex area of law, and, until the IRS or a court provides direct guidance on the taxation, taxpayers may be left guessing how exercising their copyright termination right and subsequent transactions may be taxed.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Laura Woods, How Much Money Did the Music Industry Lose in 2020, Yahoo (Dec. 31, 2020), https://www.yahoo.com/now/much-money-did-music-industry-010024795.html.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Mark Savage, Musicians Will Lose Two-Thirds of Their Income in 2020, BBC (Nov. 18, 2020), https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54966060.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Tim Ingham, New Music Drops Every Minute.

Publicity, however, often leads to greater scrutiny by taxing authorities. Accordingly, it is critical that sellers of music catalogs understand the tax issues associated with a catalog sale, as music industry practice and historic legal debate over certain copyright issues creates ambiguous and, sometimes uncertain, tax treatment.</p> <p>From a copyright perspective, songs exist in two forms: a copyright in the musical work (i.e., original compositions) and a copyright to the sound recording (i.e., the master recording of the musical composition).<sup>1</sup> In the music industry, these assets generally are characterized, respectively, as publishing and recording. The publishing side generally consists of 1) a composer and/or lyricist (each, a \"songwriter\") writing a musical composition (i.e., melody, rhythm, harmony expressed in a system of musical notation and accompanying lyrics, if any) which is copyrighted upon creation in a tangible medium (recordation is not required), and 2) a music publisher that is responsible for registering the compositions with the various U.S. domestic licensing and collection organizations (e.g., American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), Society of European Stage Authors and Composers (SESAC), Global Music Rights, Harry Fox Agency) and the U.S. Copyright Office, promoting and monetizing musical compositions, and ensuring that music artists receive royalties for their compositions.<sup>2</sup> Although how publishers monetize musical compositions has drastically changed over the decades, a publisher's role in commercializing musical works of songwriters generally has remained constant. A publisher's most lucrative form of monetization often is for recording artists to record an expression of the musical composition, resulting in a \"master recording\" that is licensed to various third parties to be distributed in an audio format.</p> <p>A songwriter's arrangement commonly may take the form of 1) an administration agreement, 2) a co-publishing deal, or 3) a full-publishing deal. In an administration agreement, the songwriter retains full ownership and control over the copyright in the musical work and engages the publisher to collect and audit royalties on behalf of the songwriter in exchange for a percentage (typically 10-25 percent, or less in some instances) of the publisher's share as an administration fee.<sup>3</sup> In a co-publishing deal, the copyright is initially held equally among the songwriter and the publisher (subject to reversion to the songwriter after a period of years less than the life of the copyright) with the songwriter's retaining 50 percent of royalties (the \"writer's share\") and the balance split equally among the songwriter and publisher (collectively, the \"publisher's share\").<sup>4</sup> In a full-publishing deal, the songwriter generally assigns 100 percent of the copyright in the musical work to the publisher, usually for the life of the copyright, in exchange for the writer's share, with the publisher's retaining the full publisher's share.<sup>5</sup></p> <p>In certain cases, songwriters may be engaged on a work-for-hire basis, particularly in the context of a composer's creating music for other media, such as film or television.<sup>6</sup> In a work-for-hire agreement, the party commissioning the work will own the copyright upon creation, and the songwriter is paid a \"royalty\" agreed upon among the parties. As a songwriter becomes more successful, he or she is in a stronger negotiating position to retain more control over the copyright and retain a larger portion of the overall royalties.</p> <p>On the other hand, with respect to recording artists, ever since sound recordings became protected works under federal copyright law in the early 1970s, record labels have made an industry practice to include boilerplate language in recording agreements that the works created under the contract are works made for hire.<sup>7</sup> Presumably, this was a result of greater negotiation power of the record labels and a mechanism to mitigate financial risk inherent in the music industry. Although payment mechanisms may vary, record deals that shift financial risk from the record label to the recording artist often result in the recording artist's being entitled to a greater share of record royalties.<sup>8</sup></p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Music%20Catalog%20Sale/#royalty-collection","title":"Royalty Collection","text":"<p>One of the exclusive benefits of copyright ownership in musical works is the right to perform the song publicly.<sup>9</sup> To mitigate the publishers' administrative burden of obtaining thousands of licenses from all music distribution platforms for public performance of a song, songwriters and publishers affiliate with performing rights organizations, or \"PROs\" (e.g., BMI, ASCAP), that correspondingly issue a blanket license to the end-user in exchange for an annual fee, allowing the user to perform all compositions controlled by all songwriters and publishers affiliated with the applicable PRO.<sup>10</sup></p> <p>With respect to publishing deals, approximately 51.5 percent of publishing royalties are generated from nondigital performance (e.g., television and terrestrial radio) and digital performance (e.g., streaming, satellite radio) of a song.<sup>11</sup> The remaining publishing royalties are derived approximately equally from mechanical royalties<sup>12</sup> and direct licensing.<sup>13</sup> Harry Fox Agency and Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency are two major organizations that issue mechanical licenses for publishers, enforce payment by licensees, and account to the publisher.<sup>14</sup> Except for digital performance recording royalties, which are collected and remitted to the recipient by SoundExchange (a nonprofit collective rights management organization), recording royalties generally are collected by the publisher, rather than the PROs, with the publisher's retaining the publisher's share of royalties and then remitting the writer's share of royalties to the songwriter. The volume and complexity of royalty collection often requires detailed auditing of royalty statements to ensure accuracy.<sup>15</sup></p> <p>While royalty income is subject to ordinary income tax rates (currently, a maximum federal rate of 37 percent), a sale of a music catalog may result in long-term capital gain subject to a lower tax rate (currently, a maximum federal rate of 20 percent) if held for more than one year.<sup>16</sup> The purpose of affording capital gain treatment at preferential rates is to ameliorate the hardship of taxation of the entire gain on the sale of property in one year to the extent that the gain is a realization of appreciation in value over a substantial period of time.<sup>17</sup> There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. For example, certain music assets are among the assets statutorily enumerated as ordinary assets but which may be eligible for capital gain treatment if certain requirements are satisfied.<sup>18</sup> In addition, courts apply the so-called \"substitute for ordinary income doctrine\" to prevent taxpayers from inappropriately converting what otherwise would be ordinary income into capital gain to undermine the policy for treating capital assets differently.<sup>19</sup> Importantly, the U.S. Supreme Court has expressed that preferential capital gain treatment was intended only for dispositions of property that are not in the ordinary course of business.<sup>20</sup></p> <p>Expressly excluded from the definition of capital asset are \"a copyright\u2026[or] musical\u2026composition\" 1) held by a taxpayer whose \"personal efforts\" created such property or 2) received by such taxpayer in a carryover basis transaction (e.g., a capital contribution to a partnership).<sup>21</sup> Property is considered created, in whole or in part, by the personal efforts of a taxpayer if such taxpayer performs literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or other creative or productive work which affirmatively contributes to the creation of the property, or if such taxpayer directs and guides others in the performance of such work.<sup>22</sup> A taxpayer, however, may elect to treat musical compositions or copyrights in musical works as capital assets in a sale or exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1221(b)(3).<sup>23</sup></p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Music%20Catalog%20Sale/#copyright-transfers","title":"Copyright Transfers","text":"<p>A transfer of a copyright for the life of the copyright (or in perpetuity) is treated as a sale for income tax purposes whereas any period less is a license.<sup>24</sup> The life of a copyright created by an individual author is the life of the author plus 70 years (or the life of the last surviving author in the case of joint works).<sup>25</sup> Thus, in an administration agreement, the songwriter owns the copyright and any rights granted to the publisher under such agreement likely is treated as a license for tax purposes. Similarly, in a co-publishing deal, the songwriter retains 50 percent ownership of the copyright and the remaining 50 percent typically reverts to the songwriter during the life of the copyright. Accordingly, to the extent a songwriter's deal is an administration agreement or co-publishing deal, a sale of the songwriter's publishing catalog likely may be treated as a sale of musical compositions or copyrights in musical works to the extent owned by the songwriter and, therefore, eligible for elective capital asset treatment.</p> <p>Full-publishing deals often leave taxpayers scratching their heads as to whether capital gain treatment is available because the copyright was transferred immediately upon creation, in perpetuity, to the publisher, and they are thus selling the writer's share (not the copyright). There are no direct authorities on point, so the answer remains open for Congress or the courts to determine. The IRS Chief Counsel's Office, however, previously concluded that the writer's share is a royalty payment, rather than compensation for services, for income tax purposes, even though the songwriter receiving the writer's share was neither the direct owner of the copyright nor a direct licensor.<sup>26</sup> Other authorities have made clear that in order for a payment to be classified as a \"royalty\" for income tax purposes the recipient of the payment must have a proprietary interest in the copyright.<sup>27</sup> Therefore, it follows that, for income tax purposes, if a payment with respect to the writer's share is a royalty, then the writer's share likely constitutes an ownership interest in the underlying copyright. This conclusion may further be supported under copyright law when the songwriter is the beneficial owner of the musical composition immediately after the assignment of the copyright in exchange for royalties.<sup>28</sup> On this theory, a songwriter may be able to elect capital gain treatment upon the sale of the songwriter's writer's share.</p> <p>An ambiguity arises, however, if the writer's share is not respected as an ownership interest in the copyright. In that case, it may be viewed as a contractual right to receive royalties. Even if this were the case, however, it does not conclusively follow that gain from the sale of the writer's share is ordinary income. If the writer's share does not constitute an ownership interest in copyrights, then it is not within the statutorily enumerated list of ordinary assets. An asset that is not within such list is a capital asset unless the substitute for ordinary income doctrine applies.</p> <p>Under this doctrine, some courts have looked to whether the taxpayer was paid for the right to receive future ordinary income or for an increase in the value of income-producing property.<sup>29</sup> The question, therefore, is whether the sale proceeds received for the writer's share are a payment for future royalty income or the increase in value of income-producing property. A writer's share certainly can increase in value. For example, in 1985, Michael Jackson purchased ATV Music (which owned the Beatles' publishing catalog) for $47.5 million. Jackson sold half for $100 million in 1995 and his estate sold the remaining half for $750 million in 2016, yielding 1,600 percent appreciation.<sup>30</sup> Although the ATV Music assets represented the publisher's share, the value of the writer's share is intrinsically linked to the value of the publisher's share as exploitation of the sound recording correspondingly exploits the musical composition.</p> <p>While the substitute for ordinary income doctrine has existed since 1941, the case law is somewhat scattered. For example, the Third Circuit has endeavored to articulate a definitive test<sup>31</sup> while the Ninth Circuit has generally evaluated the substitute for ordinary income doctrine on a case-by-case basis.<sup>32</sup> Nevertheless, based on general tax principles, treating profit from the sale of the writer's share as capital gain seems reasonably appropriate because 1) legal authorities imply that the writer's share may be a property interest in certain circumstances, 2) gain from the sale of the writer's share may represent a realization of appreciation in value in such property over a substantial period of time (as illustrated by the ATV Music example), and 3) the disposition of which is not in the ordinary course of business. Further, capital gain treatment may be appropriate under the substitute for ordinary income doctrine because the sale does not inappropriately convert what would otherwise be ordinary income to capital gain given that Congress intended for songwriters to elect to treat a property interest in a musical composition or copyright in musical work as capital gain.<sup>33</sup> It is reasonable that this result may also follow if a songwriter were to sell his or her non-performance writer's share and retain his or her performance writer's share, or vice versa, because each stream is attributable to separate exclusive rights of copyright\u2014the right to reproduce and the right to perform\u2014which are both divisible property rights.<sup>34</sup></p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Music%20Catalog%20Sale/#works-made-for-hire","title":"Works Made for Hire","text":"<p>Under the work made for hire doctrine, the hiring party is treated as the owner of the copyright from creation, rather than the songwriter or recording artist, if such musician is 1) an employee or 2) an independent contractor included in any one of nine statutorily enumerated categories and the parties expressly agree in writing that the work is a work made for hire.<sup>35</sup> Importantly, for this purpose, the evaluation of employee status is governed by the law of agency, not tax law, and of the nine enumerated categories, record companies have always relied on copyrights to sound recordings falling within two of the nine categories (collective works and compilations).<sup>36</sup> Notably, copyrights to musical works and copyrights to sound recordings are not included in the statutorily enumerated list (unless part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work), which has led to decades of debate among recording artists and record companies. This is important from a copyright perspective because, if a work is a work made for hire, the musician does not have a statutory copyright termination right. If a work is not a work made for hire, then the musician is treated as the author for copyright purposes and has a termination right that permits the musician, for no consideration, to reclaim ownership of the U.S. copyrights to the master recordings (or copyright to the musical works, as applicable) previously assigned to the record company after 35 to 40 years from the date of assignment.<sup>37</sup> While songwriters and recording artists should prefer that the deal not be a work made for hire so that they retain their copyright termination right, this preference is also of critical importance for capital gain treatment in the event of a sale of the musician's catalog.</p> <p>The statutorily enumerated work-for-hire list was heavily debated when the Copyright Act of 1976 was drafted.<sup>38</sup> Coincidentally, during this period, record companies had more control over the recording process and likely viewed recording artists as employees and, therefore, did not perceive the need to include sound recordings within the enumerated list. As new genres of music spawned throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, record companies continued to exploit music primarily in the form of album sales (e.g., vinyl records and CDs). As recording artists trended away from employment status, record companies began to hang their proverbial hat on the enumerated categories of collective works and compilations given that music continued to be sold primarily as albums (and not as individual songs). As technology advanced, the way by which music fans consumed music shifted from purchasing albums to individual songs through digital platforms (e.g., iTunes) and, ultimately, streaming.</p> <p>As a result, record companies' confidence in where they hung their hats appeared to deflate when, in the late 1990s, their lobbyists managed to arrange an amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976 to include sound recordings as the tenth enumerated work made for hire category for independent contractors in legislation intended to provide only for legislative corrections.<sup>39</sup> Public outcry by the recording artist community led their advocates to argue that the amendment was a substantive amendment, rather than a technical correction clarifying existing law, and was, thus, overreaching. Ultimately, the amendment to include sound recordings was repealed, suggesting that it was a substantive change and, therefore, not within the nine enumerated categories. Congress, however, added statutory language that provides that the addition and subsequent repeal should not be considered or otherwise given any legal significance or interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval of any judicial determination (although courts have found otherwise).<sup>40</sup></p> <p>If this legislative history did not confuse the issue enough, record companies continue to negotiate language in recording agreements that the master recording is intended to be a work made for hire and, even if it were not, then the recording artist will immediately assign the master recording to the record company. Importantly, if a master recording is not a work made for hire, the recording artist is the initial owner of the sound recording, from a copyright perspective, immediately upon creation and prior to transfer; whereas, if it is a work made for hire, then the recording artist never had an ownership interest in the copyright to the master recording.</p> <p>Whether a sound recording is a work made for hire is a threshold question when analyzing the character of gain in connection with master recording catalog assets. Specifically, the IRS released a general counsel memorandum in 1979 (one year after the Copyright Act of 1976 became effective) that provided that a recording royalty income stream was merely a right to receive compensation for services if the recording artist has never owned an interest in the master recording.<sup>41</sup> A work made for hire is the only circumstance, from a copyright perspective, in which the recording artist would never have had initial ownership of a master recording.<sup>42</sup> The tax court later confirmed that if a sound recording is a work made for hire, then the right to receive \"royalties\" is merely a right to receive compensation for personal services rendered.<sup>43</sup></p> <p>Courts and the IRS have not ruled on whether gain on the sale of a recording royalty stream (or a film or TV composer's writer's share) derived from a work-for-hire relationship should be treated as capital gain or ordinary income. Under the substitute for ordinary income doctrine, however, such gain may constitute ordinary income as a payment accelerating receipt of compensation unless the taxpayer can establish that, in this context, it is appropriate to treat the character of the gain as capital.</p> <p>Importantly, whether a sound recording is a work made for hire is governed by copyright law rather than contract. If Congress were to determine that a sound recording is not within any of the nine enumerated work-made-for-hire categories, then the recording artist would be the initial owner of the master recording to the extent the artist is not treated as an employee. From there, the analysis generally would be similar to an assignment of a copyright in musical work to the publisher under a full-publishing deal. In this context, however, there is further ambiguity as to whether a sound recording falls within IRC Section 1221(b)(3), which generally applies to dispositions of \"musical compositions or copyrights in musical works.\" The IRC fails to define either term. In such a case, words in a statute generally are presumed to bear their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, and courts have consulted the definitions of those terms in popular dictionaries.<sup>44</sup> The Encyclopedia Britannica, for example, defines \"musical composition\" as the act of conceiving a piece of music, the art of creating music, or the finished product.<sup>45</sup> The general public commonly perceives the finished product to be the song they hear (e.g., the sound recording) and, therefore, under this theory, a sound recording may be eligible for elective capital gain treatment. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that a sound recording is considered a derivative work of a copyright in musical work for copyright purposes and treating a recording artist the same as a record company with respect to character of gain is consistent with the underlying legislative history of IRC Section 1221(b)(3).<sup>46</sup></p>"},{"location":"Tax/Tax%20-%20Music%20Catalog%20Sale/#sale-of-assets","title":"Sale of Assets","text":"<p>In addition, the overall catalog may be sold with other assets, such as the songwriter's or recording artist's trademark and name and likeness. With respect to the trademark, agreements typically are prepared as a limited assignment subject to quality control limitation approval over the use of the trademark outside of past practice. This generally constitutes the retention of a significant right and, thus, any value attributable to the trademark should be ordinary income.<sup>47</sup> Although gain from the sale of name and likeness generally is treated as ordinary income, such gain arguably may be capital to the extent limited to the sale and advertising of the music catalog.<sup>48</sup></p> <p>Parties also should not overlook the potential for net investment income tax that may arise in certain passive (investment) activities. In certain cases, an additional 3.8 percent Medicare tax applies on top of the 20 percent long-term capital gain rate to the extent that the seller is not sufficiently active in the business.<sup>49</sup> In order to be active, the taxpayer recognizing the gain needs to qualify under one of seven tests. The most obvious category under which a musician could qualify is if the songwriter or recording artist materially participated in performing arts activity for any three prior tax years.<sup>50</sup> Ambiguities do arise, however, when the musician's career has changed. For example, if the musician retires and has not toured or recorded in decades, a different test may be more applicable. In addition, some songwriters and recording artists may need to consider whether they can group their songwriting, recording, touring, and other business activities together in order to mitigate the 3.8 percent tax.<sup>51</sup></p> <p>Although capital gain tax treatment of a music catalog seems fairly straightforward on first glance\u2014the sale of a \"musical composition or copyrights in musical works\"\u2014the complexity of the publishing business and ambiguities ingrained in the recording business often leave taxpayers uncertain given the lack of legal authorities expressly addressing the character of gain arising from catalog sales. Given these uncertainties, taxpayers often seek an independent tax opinion to provide accountants with comfort reporting the gain as capital, and a reasoned tax opinion will relieve the taxpayer of potentially significant penalties for substantially understating taxes paid on capital gain that the IRS determines should have been taxable as ordinary income. For now, songwriters and recording artists may be left strumming a guitar or singing a cappella until there is further guidance from Congress or courts.</p> <ol> <li> <p>U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, CIRCULAR 50: COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION FOR MUSICAL, available at https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ50.pdf; U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, CIRCULAR 56A: COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION OF MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS AND SOUND RECORDINGS, available at https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf [hereinafter CIRCULAR 56A].\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>See JAY SHANKER, ET AL., THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO ENTERTAINMENT LAW: DEALMAKING \u00b68.1.2 (2018); Dmitry Pastukhov, Music Publishing 101: Copyrights, Publishing Royalties, Common Deal Types, &amp; More, Soundcharts Blog (Nov. 20, 2019), https://soundcharts.com/blog/how-the-music-publishing-works [hereinafter Pastukhov].\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Id.
