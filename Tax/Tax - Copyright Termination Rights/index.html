<p>In 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic devastated the music touring industry, music streaming revenues surged by more than $1 billion as fans streamed more music from home. Meanwhile, as touring came to a complete standstill, global music revenue declined by 25 percent as a whole,<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and musicians lost two-thirds of their income.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> As a result, music artists continue to pursue alternative sources of revenue, including through catalogue sales.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> These factors, among others, may partially contribute to the increase in catalog sales at historically high prices.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Under these circumstances, some musicians may seek to exercise their statutory right to reacquire previously transferred copyrights (referred to in practice as the “copyright termination right” or the “termination right”) in order to renegotiate their original deals under current favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>In trying to reclaim a copyright, a critical question is whether the copyright assignment was treated as a “sale” or “license” for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>In general, an author—including a musician—can reacquire profitable copyrights if the author is able to terminate the grant that transferred the copyright interest. Recognizing that many authors historically had transferred their copyrights from a position of unequal bargaining power, Congress enacted Section 203 of the Copyright Act when it last overhauled the copyright regime in 1976. This statute allows certain individual authors to terminate transfers of their copyrighted works that were transferred on or after January 1, 1978, between 35 and 40 years after the initial grant by license or sale, subject to certain statutory requirements.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In this context, a “grant” includes any sale of a copyright or any license of a copyright (exclusive or nonexclusive), lasting for a period longer than 35 years.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Notably, the author may reclaim the transferred copyright(s) from the grantee (or their successor in interest) without paying consideration; the author simply needs to send a notice of termination to the grantee (or their successor in interest).<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Moreover, the copyright termination right is completely inalienable and cannot be transferred or waived by contract.<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> While powerful, the termination right has limitations. Significantly, it does not apply to works made for hire, which includes works created by employees or works created by independent contractors specially commissioned as part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>To date, the copyright termination right has become an important issue in the music business, as high-profile artists such as Prince (prior to his passing) have sent termination notices to major record labels.<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> Many lesser known artists have followed suit.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> Motion picture studios have also started to receive termination notices with respect to many scripts, including—ironically—<em>The Terminator</em>.<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> While delivery of termination notices has increasingly become more common, there is no specific guidance on how the exercise of the right is taxed, which is a critical consideration of which all authors should be informed.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<h3 id="farts">farts</h3>
<p>The appropriate tax treatment of the copyright termination right necessarily reflects its statutory origins. Congress created this unique right to “safeguard” authors in case they entered into a deal before their work could truly be valued and, therefore, effectively allows them to reevaluate their work’s true value once enough data is available.<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> The question arises, however, whether Congress may have created income tax risks for the same individual authors it aimed to protect, given that taxpayers are required to recognize income from any source derived.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> In other words, when a taxpayer disposes of a property interest and later is granted a new ownership interest in that same property when the value is substantially higher, the taxpayer generally recognizes income equal to the property’s value at the time of reacquisition. Accordingly, whether the exercise of the reversion of the previously transferred interest results in a taxable event is a critical consideration for authors when they are determining whether to exercise their termination right (in addition to legal costs). Terminations effected for copyright transfers after January 1, 1978, began in 2013 and have been rising in number ever since, yet neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any court decision has provided direct guidance on taxation of exercising the termination right.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of guidance, a worst-case scenario would be that the IRS or state taxing authority might take a position that the reversion is fully taxable, which would hurt the same individual authors Congress aimed to protect. To counter this position, it is necessary to distill this extremely negative result and offer a more complete analysis as to why the reversion should not be taxable and, for those authors to whom it is relevant, the holding period of the copyright should date back to the original ownership. Accordingly, individuals who create copyrightable works that are not works made for hire, such as musicians, screenwriters, comic book writers, novelists, and others, should be aware of the income tax risks, and any tax planning opportunities, associated with their termination right.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, a deeper understanding of the copyright termination right will aid in mapping out the appropriate income tax consequences. As noted, termination rights under Section 203 of the Copyright Act can take effect between 35 years and 40 years after the initial grant of the copyright by the author to a third party. The author must send the termination notice between 2 and 10 years prior to the effective date of the termination, which means notice must be served between 25 and 38 years after the transfer.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> During the period between service of the termination notice and the effective date of the termination, the author cannot enter into a new deal with a third party, but may enter into a new deal (i.e., renegotiate) with the original grantee or its successor in interest.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to not applying to works made for hire, the copyright termination right has other notable limitations. First, when joint authors enter into an agreement, a majority of the joint authors must exercise the right in order to terminate the grant.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> Second, the termination right only causes U.S. copyright interests to revert to the author.<sup id="fnref:19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> Accordingly, the exercise of the termination right does not affect foreign copyright rights or other intellectual property rights, such as rights to name and likeness or trademarks, transferred as part of the agreement. Last, termination does not affect ownership of derivative works created under authority of the original grant.<sup id="fnref:20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Given the complexity created by these limitations, many authors choose not to exercise their copyright termination rights. Instead, renegotiating with the original grantee may prove the better option because the author likely will still have some relationship with the grantee going forward, even after a termination, due to foreign rights or other intellectual property rights that the original grantee continues to retain.<sup id="fnref:21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> In fact, renegotiation may have been the implied congressional intent, given the exclusive negotiation period for the author and original grantee between service of the notice and the effective termination date. Moreover, in many cases, it is unlikely that a copyright retains value 35 to 40 years after original publication such that an author will incur the effort, and costs, of termination.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a copyright creator has three options when serving a termination notice: 1) reclaim the copyright on the termination’s effective date, retain his or her ownership, and enter into new license agreement(s) to monetize the asset going forward; 2) wait for the copyright to revert and sell it to any third party; or 3) renegotiate with the original transferee for additional proceeds during the aforementioned 2 to 10 year exclusive negotiation period commencing on the date the termination notice is served and ending on the termination effective date. The income tax consequences of these options should first be considered in light of the general tax principles that apply to copyrights.</p>
<p>A copyright created by an individual creator through his or her personal efforts is an ordinary asset for federal income tax purposes, the gain from the sale of which results in ordinary income, which, under current law, is subject to 17 percent more income tax than if the asset were a capital asset held by the taxpayer for more than one year.<sup id="fnref:22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:22">22</a></sup> Although musicians create music assets that otherwise fall within that construct, the tax law provides taxpayers the ability to elect capital gain treatment if the gain arises in connection with the sale of musical compositions or copyrights in musical works.<sup id="fnref:23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:23">23</a></sup> The terms “musical compositions” and “copyrights in musical works,” however, are not defined under the tax law, and, accordingly, it is appropriate to look to copyright law to define the scope of these terms for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>Under the Copyright Act, “musical composition” means music (melody, rhythm, and/or harmony expressed in a system of musical notation) and accompanying words (lyrics), if any.<sup id="fnref:24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:24">24</a></sup> “Copyrights in musical works” is a broader copyright term that includes original compositions and original arrangements or other new versions of earlier compositions to which new copyrightable authorship has been added.<sup id="fnref:25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:25">25</a></sup> Accordingly, if a musician is the owner of, and sells, a musical composition or copyright in a musical work, the musician may elect to treat the asset as the sale of a capital asset eligible for capital gain treatment.<sup id="fnref:26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:26">26</a></sup> Therefore, if the musician has a long-term holding period in the copyright (i.e., has held it for more than one year), the gain recognized on the sale may be taxed at preferential long-term capital gain rates (currently, 20 percent), rather than higher ordinary income tax rates (currently, a maximum of 37 percent).</p>
<p>Non-musicians, however, are not as fortunate. For example, book authors, comic artists, screenwriters, and the like who sell a self-created copyright will be subject to ordinary income tax rates, and, accordingly, their holding period with respect to the copyright is not relevant for purposes of character of the gain, because gain from the sale of their copyright is not eligible for capital gain.</p>
<h2 id="sale-or-license">Sale or License</h2>
<p>Since the copyright termination right may permit the copyright creator the ability to terminate a license or sale agreement and reclaim the copyright, a critical question is whether the copyright assignment was treated as a “sale” or “license” for income tax purposes. Generally, the owner of a copyright for income tax purposes is the person who, based on all of the facts and circumstances, has the “benefits and burdens” of ownership.<sup id="fnref:27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:27">27</a></sup> The benefits of ownership, for example, are the rights that a copyright owner has under Section 106 of the Copyright Act, such as the right to exploit and reproduce the copyrighted work.<sup id="fnref:28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:28">28</a></sup> Burdens of ownership may include a third party bringing an action for copyright infringement against the copyright holder.</p>
<p>For income tax purposes, a transfer of the copyright, whether by assignment or exclusive license, to a third party in exchange for consideration for the life of the copyright is treated as a “sale,” whereas any transfer of the copyright for less than the life of the copyright or nonexclusive license is treated as a “license.”<sup id="fnref:29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:29">29</a></sup> The distinction is important because if a transfer agreement is treated as a license for income tax purposes, the tax analysis with respect to the exercise of the copyright termination right is fairly straightforward. Under a license arrangement, the copyright holder never relinquishes ownership of the copyright but, rather, permits the licensee to use the copyright for a specified period of time or for a specified purpose. When the license is terminated, the right to use the copyright correspondingly terminates, but ownership of the copyright is always maintained by the licensor for income tax purposes. A termination of a license arrangement generally should not result in a tax liability to the licensor.<sup id="fnref:30"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:30">30</a></sup> Furthermore, a renegotiation of the license with the original licensee should be treated similarly with respect to the termination of the original deal.</p>
<p>If, however, a transfer agreement was treated as a sale for income tax purposes (whether by actual sale or perpetual exclusive license), the taxation of a reversion of the copyright to the creator pursuant to a copyright termination right exercise is unclear, as there are no tax authorities addressing the tax consequences. The three primary issues are 1) whether there is a taxable event upon the previously sold copyrights reverting to the seller as a result of exercising the termination right, 2) whether the seller may recognize long-term capital gain if the seller reclaims the copyright and subsequently sells the copyright, and 3) how a renegotiation with the original grantee should be viewed from an income tax perspective.</p>
<h2 id="option-or-reversionary-interest">Option or Reversionary Interest</h2>
<p>The income tax consequence of exercising a copyright termination right is a critical determining factor as to whether to exercise the right and/or how to structure any termination of the transfer. The author may choose not to exercise the termination right if terminating the transfer of the copyright would result in a substantial tax liability without the receipt of cash to cover the tax. Accordingly, it is important to understand whether an author who sold his or her copyright recognizes taxable income upon reversion of the copyright interest pursuant to the termination right. The crux of the analysis is determining the character of the termination right based on general income tax principles. Possible income tax characterizations may be that the termination right is a compensatory option, a non-compensatory option, or a reversionary property interest.<sup id="fnref:31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The IRS theoretically could assert that the copyright termination right is a compensatory option on the theory that the author’s personal efforts created the asset and the termination right materializes by statute upon the creation of the asset.<sup id="fnref:32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:32">32</a></sup> Under this construct, the termination right could be viewed as an option to reacquire the copyright in 35-40 years after transfer at an exercise price of zero. Upon exercise of a compensatory option, an option holder generally must include in income the difference between the fair market value of the property acquired and the exercise price, which would result in the author’s recognizing ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the copyright at the time the copyright reverts to the author.<sup id="fnref:33"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Not only is this result inconsistent with the general policy of the copyright termination right safeguarding the author, under applicable law, compensatory options generally are options granted by a service recipient to “employees or independent contractors” in connection with the performance of services.<sup id="fnref:34"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:34">34</a></sup> In the context of an individual author, no employee or independent contractor relationship exists at the time of creation or at the time of a sale and, thus, treatment of the termination right as a compensatory option is not appropriate.<sup id="fnref:35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>In accordance with the underlying policy of safeguarding the author, a reversion that does not result in a tax liability would be the more equitable and likely outcome. For example, another possibility for income tax purposes is that the copyright termination right may be treated as a non-compensatory option in the hands of the creator on the basis that the option springs into existence in connection with, and upon the sale of, the copyright to the initial grantee. Under general tax principles, the exercise of a non-compensatory call option generally does not create taxable income upon the purchase of the underlying property to which the option relates.<sup id="fnref:36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:36">36</a></sup> If this were the case, however, the holding period of the copyright would start on the date that the copyright reverts to the author.<sup id="fnref:37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:37">37</a></sup> Holding periods, however, are irrelevant to non-musicians given that, upon a sale, their self-created copyrights are ordinary assets, subject to ordinary income tax rates, and not eligible to be treated as capital assets for which holding periods are meaningful. Musicians, however, may elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets. But should the musician immediately resell the reclaimed copyright, the sale would be subject to ordinary income tax rates because capital gain on an asset held for one year or less is short-term capital gain subject to ordinary income tax rates.<sup id="fnref:38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Fortunately for musicians, however, an alternative avenue exists. The copyright termination right more likely should be treated as a future reversionary interest that vests upon service of the termination notice. Under The Third Restatement of Property Law, a “future interest” is an “ownership interest in property that does not currently entitle the owner to possession or enjoyment of the property.”<sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:39">39</a></sup> The Restatement further describes any future interest held by a transferor of property as a “reversion.”<sup id="fnref:40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:40">40</a></sup> The terminations right appears to fit this description.</p>
<p>With respect to reversions, the Tax Court has held that a lessor’s reversionary interest in a 99-year ground lease does not get taxed until the future interest is sold or redeemed, implying that the vesting of the future interest after 99 years does not result in taxable income.<sup id="fnref:41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:41">41</a></sup> The copyright termination right may be treated similarly for income tax purposes. Accordingly, characterizing the termination right as a reversionary property interest generally should not result in taxable income upon the termination’s taking effect, which aligns with congressional intent to safeguard authors.</p>
<p>Notably, taxpayers who hold a future interest generally start their holding period upon acquisition of the future interest (i.e., upon the author’s creation of the copyright), not upon the reversion, regardless of whether the future interest is vested or contingent.<sup id="fnref:42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:42">42</a></sup> Thus, the musician should still be eligible for long-term capital gain even if the musician sells the musical composition or copyright in the musical work immediately after the copyright termination right reversion. Accordingly, under this reversionary interest construct, the author may reclaim the copyright without recognizing tax upon exercise of the termination right and retain his or her original holding period such that, in the case of a musician, long-term capital gain treatment on a subsequent, immediate sale is possible.</p>
<p>Under this reversionary interest construct, the income tax consequences of a renegotiation with the original grantee appear to be in line with congressional intent to provide musicians with the ability to elect capital gain treatment. If viewed as a future interest, then a renegotiation likely should constitute a sale of a future interest in the musical copyright to the original grantee and should fall squarely within the purview of the Internal Revenue Code Section 1221(b)(3) election to treat sales or exchanges of musical compositions or copyrights in musical works as capital assets. In contrast, if viewed as an option, the closing of the renegotiation may be treated as the cancellation of the option, given that the effect is that the taxpayer will not reclaim the musical composition or copyright in a musical work to either retain ownership or sell it to a third party. Gain recognized from termination of a right (such as an option) with respect to property that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer is treated as gain from the sale of a capital asset.<sup id="fnref:43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:43">43</a></sup> In the case of a musical composition or copyright in musical work, however, the asset in the hands of the taxpayer is an ordinary asset that requires the taxpayer to make an affirmative election to treat the underlying asset as a capital asset upon a sale or exchange. Accordingly, there is risk that the IRS may treat the gain from the deemed termination of the option as ordinary income if the ability to elect otherwise is not taken into account.<sup id="fnref:44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>While it is unclear how a taxing authority or a court would rule on the characterization issue from a tax perspective, the statutory language and federal case law suggest that the copyright termination right resembles a reversionary interest more than it does an option from a non-tax perspective. In fact, the termination right statute itself provides that the copyright rights in a terminated grant “revert” to the author once the termination takes effect and that the “future rights” become “vested” once the author serves the termination notice.<sup id="fnref:45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:45">45</a></sup> Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court described the post-termination interest as a “reversion,”<sup id="fnref:46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:46">46</a></sup> and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals referred to the termination right as a “future interest.”<sup id="fnref:47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that the author may exercise the right at-will seems more like an option. As noted above, however, gain recognized in connection with exercising a non-compensatory option followed by an immediate sale of the copyright to a third party or exercising the copyright termination right to renegotiate with the original transferee may result in ordinary income, which does not synchronize with congressional intent to provide capital gain treatment to musicians and safeguard authors with a termination right. In addition, options generally have strike prices in excess of zero, and option holders usually pay premiums in exchange for their options. Treating the termination right as an option would require concluding that it represents an option with a zero strike price for which the author paid no premium. Furthermore, treating the termination right as a non-compensatory option seems like an odd result because the non-compensatory option may be ignored for income tax purposes, given that an option with an exercise price of zero may be sufficiently certain to be exercised during the exercise period since the option likely will be “in the money.”<sup id="fnref:48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>The unique nature of the copyright termination right presents a gray area in terms of characterization for income tax purposes. On balance, however, treatment as a reversionary property interest appears more accurate from a non-tax perspective and would harmonize Congress’s intent underlying the termination right to safeguard authors with more recent congressional intent to provide capital gains eligibility to musicians.</p>
<p>A judge presiding over one of the many litigations regarding the rights to Superman once said that “[the] intricate [termination] provisions oftentimes create unexpected pitfalls that thwart or blunt the effort of the terminating party to reclaim the full measure of the copyright in a work of authorship.”<sup id="fnref:49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:49">49</a></sup> Tax considerations further complicate this already complex area of law, and, until the IRS or a court provides direct guidance on the taxation, taxpayers may be left guessing how exercising their copyright termination right and subsequent transactions may be taxed.</p>

<p>I.R.C. § 1221(b)(3). Artists looking to sell their catalogs and associated income streams must closely examine their prior contracts to determine whether they truly own (or owned) the copyrights for income tax purposes, such that they can elect capital gain treatment upon a future sale. The sale of a contractual right to receive income, such as a writer’s share or publishing rights, may be ineligible for capital gain treatment in the event the artist does not own the copyright for income tax purposes because the artist only had a financial interest in the copyright, as opposed to true ownership.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:26" title="Jump back to footnote 26 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Under I.R.C. § 1221(a)(3), a self-created copyright is treated as an ordinary asset (rather than a capital asset), and the legislative intent indicates that Congress intended to tax gains arising from the sale of copyrights created individually through personal efforts as “ordinary income derived as compensation for personal services.” See S. Rep. No. 552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), reprinted at 1969-3 C.B. 423, 549.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:32" title="Jump back to footnote 32 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>A compensatory option with an exercise price less than fair market value also may result in substantial tax penalties under I.R.C. § 409A (20 percent federal excise tax and 5 percent California excise tax), which is another reason that Congress likely did not intend for the termination right to be treated as a compensatory option.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:35" title="Jump back to footnote 35 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
